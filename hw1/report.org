*NOTES:* 
1) In this assignment, the new "[[http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html#][requests]]" python library was used, and
   not =urllib=, as suggested in the tutorial. The web (and python)
   have evolved since python 2.5, used in the nltk book, was released
   in 2008. 
2) Additionally, since =xgoogle= seemed to return very few results
   (1-3 on most searches), I used [[http://breakingcode.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/google-search-python/][this script]] instead. 
3) This document has some equations that require javascript to run,
   and an internet connection (to http://orgmode.org/ for the functions).
4) This document looks best on Google's Chrome/Chromium browser.

* Data Exploration [1/1]
** DONE Gathering and cleaning up data
   CLOSED: [2012-04-30 Mon 22:44]

1) *Errors met while dealing with the Google engine:* \\
   Using the xgoogle library, only produced 1-3 result URLs for the
   searches, so I tried several alternatives: the python-duckduckgo
   library, but this only produced 1 result per query (duckduckgo only
   supplies a 'zero-click' api). Eventually, I used [[http://breakingcode.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/google-search-python/][this script]], which
   worked perfectly.
   
1) *Errors met while downloading the material from the Google hits:* \\
   I had no trouble, and was using the "requests" library.
   
1) *Errors met while cleaning up the HTML pages:* \\
   The built-in =nltk.clean_html= function did only a mediocre job
   cleaning the contents of the web pages, leaving in some irrelevant
   strings. Using the justext library worked perfectly.
   
1) *Errors met while segmenting the text into sentences and words:* \\
   Headlines were not segmented in to different sentences, but were
   instead included in the following sentence.
   The em-dash (represented as "- -", without spaces) was not regarded as separating
   between words when it should have been. For example, in: "sliding/N
   movement- -the/DET days/N of/P heaving/VG" we can see the words
   'movement' and 'the' *not* separated.

1) *Errors met by the automatic tagger:* \\
   When fed sentences that were correctly segmented to to words, and
   were also complete, and valid - I had no corrections to
   offer. Perhaps it's my lack of competence as a tagger for English
   words.. 


This is the code I used:
#+INCLUDE: "code.py" src python

In order to compare two taggers, I wrote the function:
#+INCLUDE "code2.py" src python :lines "265-277"
** Gathering basic statistics
   *IMPORTANT:* the code snippets in this section use the =tagged_words=
   corpus (NOT =tagged_sents=).


   To create Figure 1:
   
#+CAPTION: *Figure 1*
#+ATTR_HTML: width="800"
   [[file:ambiguity-fig1.png]]
   
   I used the following code:
#+INCLUDE "code2.py" src python :lines "1-41"
   
   For the requested functions, This code was used:
#+INCLUDE "code2.py" src python :lines "44-73"

** Is there a correlation between word size or frequency and ambiguity level?
   To try and answer this question, I plotted the requested 3D graph
   (figure 2a):
#+CAPTION: *Figure 2a*
#+ATTR_HTML: width="950"
[[file:ambiguity1x2.png]]

In order to better understand it, I also looked at the 3 2D
Projections of it (figure 2b), and used a logarithmic scale for word
frequency (figure 3c):
#+CAPTION: *Figure 2b - linear projections*
#+ATTR_HTML: width="950"
[[file:ambiguity2x2.png]]

#+CAPTION: *Figure 2c - logarithmic projections*
#+ATTR_HTML: width="950"
[[file:ambiguity2x2-log.png]]

Two correlations are clearly visible: *word frequency - word length* (as
discussed in class, due to "evolution" maybe), and *word ambiguity -
word length* (probably not a strictly linear correlation).\\
It looks probable, that there is also some correlation between *word
ambiguity - word frequency*, however, it's difficult to decide whether
this correlation will exist after taking into account the previous two
correlation, since they appear to be much more significant.\\
It is also worth noting that  all these observations were made with
only looking at the graphs, and might be wrong when tested for
statistical significance.


This is the code used (with minor changes or commenting
out, to create the different graphs):
#+INCLUDE "code2.py" src python :lines "76-122"

#+END_EXAMPLE
We can clearly see that cutting off according to ANY criteria, causes
a degradation in the tagger's performance, except for the case when
=H_param= was high ($\frac{7}{9}$, $\frac{8}{9}$), where cutoff values
of 1-3 are equally good.


1) *Does entropy filtering improve accuracy?*
   It does not (!!)

2) *How do you determine the range of values to test for the cutoff?*
   I used the values 1-5, 7, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. This was not taken
   from the corpus, but seemed to give more than reasonable cover for
   several corpora.
  
3) *Is the accuracy value evolving in a predictable manner as the cutoff varies?*
   It decreases as the cutoff increases.

4) *Describe the list of suffixes that are good tag predictors -- are
   you surprised by what you observe?*

I can see why some of these would be good predictors, especially for
the Nouns I (think I) recognize, such as "ool", "ols", "ogy", and why "'re",
but for most of them - I can't really imagine why they are so good.
I have to admit that I don't recognize any of these as a suffix I
studies in linguistics.

* Fine-grained Error Analysis [5/5]
** DONE Known vs. Unknown Accuracy
   CLOSED: [2012-05-03 Thu 01:29]

   I propose to identify known words as words that appeared more than
   $N$ times in the training corpus, where $N>0$ (I'll use $N=1$, but that's just
   one option).

   I suggest adding the code (for $N=1$): \\
#+BEGIN_SRC python
self.wordset = set([word for sentence in train for (word, tag) in sentence])
#+END_SRC   
   
   To every tagger. This could be used in the =evaluate2= method, in
   the following manner:

** DONE Sensitivity to the Size and Structure of the Training Set: Cross-Validation
   CLOSED: [2012-05-03 Thu 22:42]
   The code for the function:
#+INCLUDE "/home/lxmonk/git/nltk/nltk/tag/api.py" src python :lines "147-164"
   Produced:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In [12] t0 = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')
In [13] t1 = nltk.UnigramTagger(nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_sents(simplify_tags=True), backoff=t0)
In [14] t2 = nltk.BigramTagger(nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_sents(simplify_tags=True), backoff=t1)
In [15] table = t2.crossValidate(nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents(simplify_tags=True), 10)

 i  accuracy(i)
 --------------
 0)   0.135158702476

In [16]: average(table.values())
Out[16]: 0.47270666201604455
#+END_EXAMPLE
   We can see that the accuracy of the 0^{th} iteration is very low in
   comparison to the others. Ignoring it produces:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In [18]: average([table[i] for i in range(1,10)])
Out[18]: 0.51021199085377655
#+END_EXAMPLE
   Which is not very different. This, however, shows the importance of
   covering as much of the training set as possible, since there might
   be significant variations.
      

** DONE Stratified Samples
   CLOSED: [2012-05-04 Fri 00:33]
   To define sentence lengths, I used:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
fd = nltk.FreqDist([len(sent) for sent in nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents()])
hist(list(chain.from_iterable([[k]*fd[k] for k in fd.keys()])),
     bins=(max(fd.keys()) - min(fd.keys()) + 1))
#+END_SRC

   The histogram is this:
#+ATTR_HTML: width="950"
[[file:hist_3.5.png]]

   I choose the lengths of $short \leq 12$ (short, after first peak), 
   $12 < medium \leq 23$ (medium), and $23 < long$ (long).
   Looking at the numbers, we see it's the integer equivalent of
   dividing to 3 equal groups:
   
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} fd[i] = 57340,\: \sum_{i=0}^{12} fd[i] = 18167 \approx
\frac{1}{3} \cdot 57340,\: \sum_{i=0}^{23} fd[i] = 38322 \approx \frac{2}{3}
\cdot 57340
\end{equation}
#+INCLUDE "code2.py" src python :lines "291-328"
Perform a cycle of training-testing on the Brown corpus for the last tagger discussed in class for each of the following cases:

1) *Random split 90%-10%* \\
#+BEGIN_SRC python
In [3]: corpus = list(nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents(simplify_tags=True))

In [4]: from numpy.random import shuffle

In [5]: shuffle(corpus)

In [6]: trn = corpus[:len(corpus) * 9 / 10]

In [7]: tst = corpus[len(corpus) * 9 / 10:]

In [8]: t0 = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')

In [9]: t1 = nltk.UnigramTagger(trn, backoff=t0)

In [10]: t2 = nltk.BigramTagger(trn, backoff=t1)

In [11]: t2.evaluate(tst)
Out[11]: 0.9310641552729706
#+END_SRC 


2) *Stratified split 90%-10% according to sentence length (split
   short/medium/long)* 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
In [12]: trn, tst = stratifiedSamples([12, 23], 10)

In [13]: t0 = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')

In [14]: t1 = nltk.UnigramTagger(trn, backoff=t0)

In [15]: t2 = nltk.BigramTagger(trn, backoff=t1)

In [16]: t2.evaluate(tst)
Out[16]: 0.9313322015878732
#+END_SRC

3) *Stratified split 90%-10% according to the sentence genre.*

#+BEGIN_SRC python
In [32]: trn, tst = stratifiedSamples(CATEGORIES,10)

In [34]: t0 = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')

In [35]: t1 = nltk.UnigramTagger(trn, backoff=t0)

In [36]: t2 = nltk.BigramTagger(trn, backoff=t1)

In [37]: t2.evaluate(tst)
Out[37]: 0.9325498656042589
#+END_SRC

    We can see that all 3 cases enjoy very good accuracy $(> 0.93)$,
    with very slight improvement for the two stratified cases over the
    random one. I believe the reason for this is that the brown corpus
    has a great number of tagged sentences, and therefore the random
    sampling is as diverse and as good as the stratified ones. Perhaps
    in a smaller corpus, there would have been more visible differences.
